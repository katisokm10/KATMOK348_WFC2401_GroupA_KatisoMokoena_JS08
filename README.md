## Project Title: Singleton Pattern: BankBranch Class
This JavaScript file demonstrates the implementation of the Singleton Pattern for managing a single instance of the BankBranch class throughout the application.

The Singleton Pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created and provides a global point of access to that instance. In this example, the BankBranch class represents bank branch information, and only one instance of this class is created.
